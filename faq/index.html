<div id="MDX_ROOT_703e2097-ca59-448b-9529-9347479e0b05"><h2>The question about character class</h2>
<h3>v2</h3>
<p>In v2, there is two main Character class you can use: <code>GSCPlayerCharacter</code> and <code>GSCAICharacter</code></p>
<p>You are free to use whatever class for your base blueprint, however you have to understand why those 2 classes exists. The main difference between them:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>GSCPlayerCharacter</code>: uses PlayerState to hold the Ability System Component (ASC) and attributes. Also ASC replication mode is set to Mixed.</li>
<li><code>GSCAICharacter</code>: Does not use PlayerState and have ASC living on Pawn. Replication mode is set to Minimal.</li>
</ul>
<p>With that being said, if you look at the actual implementation, those are really thin classes. You don&#x27;t really have to merge them and feel like you should use a single base class at all cost, if you design your implementation with actor components. Most of the commonly shared functionality and API in Companion is done via <code>GSCCoreComponent</code>which is present in both character classes. You can opt to do the same.</p>
<p>The naming of those classes is a bit off and doesn&#x27;t really reflect why they&#x27;re separated.</p>
<h3>v3</h3>
<p>In v3, it has been reworked to be <code>ModularCharacter</code> (equivalent of <code>GSCAICharacter</code>, ASC on pawn) and <code>ModularPlayerStateCharacter</code> (equivalent of <code>GSCPlayerCharacter</code>, ASC on PlayerState). Also v3 allows you to change ASC replication mode on child blueprints.</p>
